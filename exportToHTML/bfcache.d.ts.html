 <span class="s3">* some number of inactive trees, by rendering them in an &lt;Activity&gt; boundary.</span>
 <span class="s3">* That means it would not make sense for the the lifetime of the cache to be</span>
 <span class="s3">* any longer than the lifetime of the React tree; e.g. if the hook were</span>

 <span class="s3">* which of those trees should have their *state* preserved, by &lt;Activity&gt;.</span>
