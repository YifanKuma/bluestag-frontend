 <span class="s0">* These are types for things that are present in the upcoming React 18 release.</span>
 <span class="s0">*</span>
 <span class="s0">* Once React 18 is released they can just be moved to the main index file.</span>
 <span class="s0">*</span>
 <span class="s0">* To load the types declared here in an actual project, there are three ways. The easiest one,</span>
 <span class="s0">* if your `tsconfig.json` already has a `&quot;types&quot;` array in the `&quot;compilerOptions&quot;` section,</span>
 <span class="s0">* is to add `&quot;react-dom/canary&quot;` to the `&quot;types&quot;` array.</span>
 <span class="s0">*</span>
 <span class="s0">* Alternatively, a specific import syntax can to be used from a typescript file.</span>
 <span class="s0">* This module does not exist in reality, which is why the {} is important:</span>
 <span class="s0">*</span>
 <span class="s0">* ```ts</span>
 <span class="s0">* import {} from 'react-dom/canary'</span>
 <span class="s0">* ```</span>
 <span class="s0">*</span>
 <span class="s0">* It is also possible to include it through a triple-slash reference:</span>
 <span class="s0">*</span>
 <span class="s0">* ```ts</span>
 <span class="s0">* /// &lt;reference types=&quot;react-dom/canary&quot; /&gt;</span>
 <span class="s0">* ```</span>
 <span class="s0">*</span>
 <span class="s0">* Either the import or the reference only needs to appear once, anywhere in the project.</span>
