<span class="s2">💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.</span>

<span class="s1">&lt;!-- end auto-generated rule header --&gt;</span>

<span class="s2">The HTML `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` element, with a valid `href` attribute, is formally defined as representing a </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s2">hyperlink</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s2">. That is, a link between one HTML document and another, or between one location inside an HTML document and another location inside the same document.</span>

<span class="s2">In fact, the interactive, underlined `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` element has become so synonymous with web navigation that this expectation has become entrenched inside browsers, assistive technologies such as screen readers and in how people generally expect the internet to behave. In short, anchors should navigate.</span>

<span class="s2">The use of JavaScript frameworks and libraries, like </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">React</span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">, has made it very easy to add or subtract functionality from the standard HTML elements. This has led to </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">anchors</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">often being used in applications based on how they look and function instead of what they represent.</span>

<span class="s2">Whilst it is possible, for example, to turn the `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` element into a fully functional `</span><span class="s1">&lt;button&gt;</span><span class="s2">` element with ARIA, the native user agent implementations of HTML elements are to be preferred over custom ARIA solutions.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">How do I resolve this error?</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Case</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">I want to perform an action and need a clickable UI element</span>

<span class="s2">The native user agent implementations of the `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` and `</span><span class="s1">&lt;button&gt;</span><span class="s2">` elements not only differ in how they look and how they act when activated, but also in how the user is expected to interact with them. Both are perfectly clickable when using a mouse, but keyboard users expect `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` to activate on `enter` only and `</span><span class="s1">&lt;button&gt;</span><span class="s2">` to activate on </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">both</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">`enter` and `space`.</span>

<span class="s2">This is exacerbated by the expectation sighted users have of how </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">buttons</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">and </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">anchors</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">work based on their appearance. Therefore we find that using </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">anchors</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">as </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">buttons</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">can easily create confusion without a relatively complicated ARIA and CSS implementation that only serves to create an element HTML already offers and browsers already implement fully accessibly.</span>

<span class="s2">We are aware that sometimes </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">anchors</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">are used instead of </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">buttons</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">to achieve a specific visual design. When using the `</span><span class="s1">&lt;button&gt;</span><span class="s2">` element this can still be achieved with styling but, due to the meaning many people attach to the standard underlined `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` due its appearance, please reconsider this in the design.</span>

<span class="s2">Consider the following</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(0)&quot; onClick={foo}&gt;Perform action&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onClick={foo}&gt;Perform action&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a onClick={foo}&gt;Perform action&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">All these </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">anchor</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">implementations indicate that the element is only used to execute JavaScript code. All the above should be replaced with</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;button onClick={foo}&gt;Perform action&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Case</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">I want navigable links</span>

<span class="s2">An `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` element without an `href` attribute no longer functions as a hyperlink. That means that it can no longer accept keyboard focus or be clicked on. The documentation for </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">no-noninteractive-tabindex</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s2">no-noninteractive-tabindex.md</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">explores this further. Preferably use another element </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">such as `div` or `span`</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">for display of text.</span>

<span class="s2">To properly function as a hyperlink, the `href` attribute should be present and also contain a valid </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">URL</span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s2">JavaScript</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s2">strings, empty values or using only </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s2">#</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s2">are not considered valid `href` values.</span>

<span class="s2">Valid `href` attributes values are</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a href=&quot;/some/valid/uri&quot;&gt;Navigate to page&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a href=&quot;/some/valid/uri#top&quot;&gt;Navigate to page and location&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Navigate to internal page location&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Case</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">I need the HTML to be interactive, don't I need to use an a tag for that?</span>

<span class="s2">An `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` tag is not inherently interactive. Without an href attribute, it really is no different from a `</span><span class="s1">&lt;span&gt;</span><span class="s2">`.</span>

<span class="s2">Let's look at an example that is not accessible by all users</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a</span>
  <span class="s4">className=&quot;thing&quot;</span>
  <span class="s4">onMouseEnter={() =&gt; this.setState({ showSomething: true })}</span>
<span class="s4">&gt;</span>
  <span class="s4">{label}</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">If you need to create an interface element that the user can click on, consider using a button</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;button</span>
  <span class="s4">className=&quot;thing&quot;</span>
  <span class="s4">onClick={() =&gt; this.setState({ showSomething: true })}</span>
<span class="s4">&gt;</span>
  <span class="s4">{label}</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">If you want to navigate while providing the user with extra functionality, for example in the `onMouseEnter` event, use an anchor with an `href` attribute containing a URL or path as its value.</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;a</span>
  <span class="s4">href={someValidPath}</span>
  <span class="s4">className=&quot;thing&quot;</span>
  <span class="s4">onMouseEnter={() =&gt; this.setState({ showSomething: true })}</span>
<span class="s4">&gt;</span>
  <span class="s4">{label}</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">If you need to create an interface element that the user can mouse over or mouse out of, consider using a div element. In this case, you may need to apply a role of presentation or an interactive role. Interactive ARIA roles include `button`, `link`, `checkbox`, `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, `option`, `radio`, `searchbox`, `switch` and `textbox`.</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;div</span>
  <span class="s4">role=&quot;menuitem&quot;</span>
  <span class="s4">className=&quot;thing&quot;</span>
  <span class="s4">onClick={() =&gt; this.setState({ showSomething: true })}</span>
  <span class="s4">onMouseEnter={() =&gt; this.setState({ showSomething: true })}</span>
<span class="s4">&gt;</span>
  <span class="s4">{label}</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">In the example immediately above an `onClick` event handler was added to provide the same experience mouse users enjoy to keyboard-only and touch-screen users. Never fully rely on mouse events alone to expose functionality.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Case</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">I use Next.js and I'm getting this error inside of `</span><span class="s1">&lt;Link&gt;</span><span class="s2">`s</span>

<span class="s2">This is a </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">known issue</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/issues/402</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">with Next.js's decision to construct internal links by nesting an href-free `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` tag inside of a `</span><span class="s1">&lt;Link&gt;</span><span class="s2">` component. Next.js is also </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">aware of the issue</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/5533</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and has an </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">RFC</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/8207</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">working towards a solution.</span>

<span class="s2">Until the Next.js API can be updated to a more performant and standard setup, you have a few workaround options</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s2">If you have only a few `Link`s, or they're clustered in just a few files like `nav.tsx`, you can use disable macros like `{/</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid </span><span class="s1">*</span><span class="s2">/}` to turn off validation of this rule for those usages.</span>

<span class="s0">2. </span><span class="s2">You can use the `Link` component's `passHref` prop to override a dummy `href` on the `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">:</span>
<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">typescript</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;Link href=&quot;/my-amazing-page&quot; passHref&gt;</span>
  <span class="s4">&lt;a href=&quot;replace&quot;&gt;Go to my amazing page&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;/Link&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s2">You can invest in a custom component that wraps the creation of the `Link` and `a`. You can then add your new custom component to the list of components to validate to ensure that your links are all created with a navigable href. A sample custom component is shared </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">here</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s5">https://gist.github.com/zackdotcomputer/d7af9901e7db87364aad7fbfadb5c99b</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">and it would be used like this</span><span class="s1">:</span>
<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">typescript</span>
<span class="s4">// Internally, LinkTo handles the making of the Link and A, collecting the</span>
<span class="s4">// need for a lint workaround into a single file.</span>
<span class="s4">// Externally, LinkTo can be linted using this rule, ensuring it will always</span>
<span class="s4">// have a valid href prop.</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;LinkTo href=&quot;/my-amazing-page&quot;&gt;Go to my amazing page&lt;/LinkTo&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Case</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">I understand the previous cases but still need an element resembling a link that is purely clickable</span>

<span class="s2">We recommend, without reserve, that elements resembling anchors should navigate. This will provide a superior user experience to a larger group of users out there.</span>

<span class="s2">However, we understand that developers are not always in total control of the visual design of web applications. In cases where it is imperative to provide an element resembling an anchor that purely acts as a click target with no navigation as result, we would like to recommend a compromise.</span>

<span class="s2">Again change the element to a `</span><span class="s1">&lt;button&gt;</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">jsx</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;button</span>
  <span class="s4">type=&quot;button&quot;</span>
  <span class="s4">className=&quot;link-button&quot;</span>
  <span class="s4">onClick={() =&gt; this.setState({ showSomething: true })}</span>
<span class="s4">&gt;</span>
  <span class="s4">Press me, I look like a link</span>
<span class="s4">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">Then use styling to change its appearance to that of a link</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">css</span>
<span class="s4">.link-button {</span>
  <span class="s4">background-color: transparent;</span>
  <span class="s4">border: none;</span>
  <span class="s4">cursor: pointer;</span>
  <span class="s4">text-decoration: underline;</span>
  <span class="s4">display: inline;</span>
  <span class="s4">margin: 0;</span>
  <span class="s4">padding: 0;</span>
<span class="s4">}</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">This button element can now also be used inline in text.</span>

<span class="s2">Once again we stress that this is an inferior implementation and some users will encounter difficulty to use your website, however, it will allow a larger group of people to interact with your website than the alternative of ignoring the rule's warning.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Rule options</span>

<span class="s2">This rule takes one optional object argument of type object</span><span class="s1">:</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">json</span>
<span class="s4">{</span>
  <span class="s4">&quot;rules&quot;: {</span>
    <span class="s4">&quot;jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid&quot;: [</span>
      <span class="s4">&quot;error&quot;,</span>
      <span class="s4">{</span>
        <span class="s4">&quot;components&quot;: [&quot;Link&quot;],</span>
        <span class="s4">&quot;specialLink&quot;: [&quot;hrefLeft&quot;, &quot;hrefRight&quot;],</span>
        <span class="s4">&quot;aspects&quot;: [&quot;noHref&quot;, &quot;invalidHref&quot;, &quot;preferButton&quot;]</span>
      <span class="s4">}</span>
    <span class="s4">]</span>
  <span class="s4">}</span>
<span class="s4">}</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">For the `components` option, these strings determine which JSX elements </span><span class="s1">(**</span><span class="s2">always including</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s2">should be checked for the props designated in the `specialLink` options </span><span class="s1">(**</span><span class="s2">always including</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s2">`href`</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s2">. This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an `</span><span class="s1">&lt;a&gt;</span><span class="s2">` element </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s2">like in React</span><span class="s1">):</span>

<span class="s0">```</span><span class="s3">js</span>
<span class="s4">// Link.js</span>
<span class="s4">const Link = props =&gt; &lt;a {...props}&gt;A link&lt;/a&gt;;</span>

<span class="s4">...</span>

<span class="s4">// NavBar.js (for example)</span>
<span class="s4">...</span>
<span class="s4">return (</span>
  <span class="s4">&lt;nav&gt;</span>
    <span class="s4">&lt;Link href=&quot;/home&quot; /&gt;</span>
  <span class="s4">&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
<span class="s4">);</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>

<span class="s2">For the `aspects` option, these strings determine which sub-rules are run. This allows omission of certain error types in restrictive environments.</span>

<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`noHref`</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Checks whether an anchor contains an `href` attribute.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`invalidHref`</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Checks if a given `href` value is valid.</span>
<span class="s0">- </span><span class="s2">`preferButton`</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s2">Checks if anchors have been used as buttons.</span>

<span class="s2">The option can be used on its own or with the `components` and `specialLink` options.</span>

<span class="s2">If omitted, all sub-rule aspects will be run by default. This is the recommended configuration for all cases except where the rule becomes unusable due to well founded restrictions.</span>

<span class="s2">The option must contain at least one `aspect`.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Succeed</span>
